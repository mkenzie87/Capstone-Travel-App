# Project 4 Instructions

This project we are using an API from meaningcloud that is a Natural Language Processor.

 Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
